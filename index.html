### Three slides I would like to see

"Ask the managers of high-performance computing centers what fraction of their budget they spent on hardware, software, and training, and what fractions they would like to spend. My prediction is:"

<image src="images/gvwilson1.png">

---

"Measure how much computing power all of the scientists at a university (not just those with HPC accounts) use during a year. My prediction is:"

<image src="images/gvwilson2.png">

---

"Classify all the support requests received by HPC center staff according to technical complexity, and see how that changes after something like a two-day Software Carpentry workshop. My prediction is:"
