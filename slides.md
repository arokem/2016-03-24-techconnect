### What is *Data Science*?

### Impactful collaborations and the challenge of novelty-squared

Collaborations of this sort don't neccesarily give me a neuroscience paper next year

But might generate the tools that every neuroscientist uses in 5 years.

Josh Bloom calls this <a href="https://medium.com/@profjsb/novelty-squared-dd88857f662#.j9jtwaxe9">"The challenge of novelty squared"</a>:

“The last thing I want to have happen with an interdisciplinary collaboration is that my CS and stats colleagues find their contribution to be routine if not mundane.”

### But this is not unique

Across campus, in many different fields

Volunteer-based organization and community of practice

Teaches researchers basic computing skills:

### Why is this worth doing?

"Ask the managers of high-performance computing centers what fraction of their budget they spent on hardware, software, and training, and what fractions they would like to spend. My prediction is:"

"Measure how much computing power all of the scientists at a university (not just those with HPC accounts) use during a year. My prediction is:"

"Classify all the support requests received by HPC center staff according to technical complexity, and see how that changes after something like a two-day Software Carpentry workshop. My prediction is:"
