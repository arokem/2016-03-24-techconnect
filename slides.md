### The future is already here

--

### ... it's just not very evenly distributed.
                                              (William Gibson)


1. Data-intensive discovery

--

1. The eScience Institute: data-science at the UW

--

1. Future proofing:
--

   - Catalyzing complicated collaborations

--

   - Building and maintaining the tools

--

   - Sustaining career paths in data-intensive research

--

  - Training data-savvy researchers

---

### The data deluge

--
It's happening across many different fields

--

Astronomy

--

Genomics

--

Social sciences

### In acadmia, Data Science faces unique challenges:

--

- Careers

--

- Education and training

--

- Tools and software

--

- Reproducibility and open science

--

- Physical and intellectual space

--

- Data Science studies

### Impactful collaborations and the challenge of novelty-squared

Work with Magda Balazinska, Alvin Cheung, from CS

Parmita Mehta, Sven Dorkenwald

Andy Connoly, Jake Vanderplas, Astronomy
Dave Williams, Biology


Collaborations of this sort don't neccesarily give me a neuroscience paper next year

But might generate the tools that every neuroscientist uses in 5 years.

Josh Bloom calls this <a href="https://medium.com/@profjsb/novelty-squared-dd88857f662#.j9jtwaxe9">"The challenge of novelty squared"</a>:

“The last thing I want to have happen with an interdisciplinary collaboration is that my CS and stats colleagues find their contribution to be routine if not mundane.”

### But this is not unique

Across campus, in many different fields

"Our mission is to engage researchers across disciplines in developing and applying advanced computational methods and tools to real world problems in data-intensive discovery"

### Open-source software: a key to reproducible science

For example: Neuroimaging in Python


--

But how do we make this possible?



---

### Teach a person to fish

<image src="images/swc-logo.png" height=200px>

--

Volunteer-based organization and community of practice

--

Teaches researchers basic computing skills:

--

1. How to use the Unix shell
1. Basic programming
1. Version control
1. Sometimes also teach SQL and/or software testing.

### Why is this worth doing?

"Ask the managers of high-performance computing centers what fraction of their budget they spent on hardware, software, and training, and what fractions they would like to spend. My prediction is:"

### Why is this worth doing?

"Measure how much computing power all of the scientists at a university (not just those with HPC accounts) use during a year. My prediction is:"

### Why is this worth doing?
"Classify all the support requests received by HPC center staff according to technical complexity, and see how that changes after something like a two-day Software Carpentry workshop. My prediction is:"

### Data Science for Social Good

Addresses two major challenges:

--

How do we enable data-driven approaches in institutions devoted to social good?

--

How do we provide training for data-scientists interested in social good?


---

### Now accepting appplications for projects until March 30th

### Come talk to us!

The eScience Institute will have a table later today.
