### Amazing opportunities...

Announced by the White House last year, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/30/fact-sheet-president-obama-s-precision-medicine-initiative"> **Precision Medicine** </a> initiative aims to make medicine:

Personalized

Predictive

Preventative

Participatory

### Challenges for DS in academia:

--

- Tools and software

--

- Reproducibility and open science

--

- Careers

--

- Education and training

--

- Physical and intellectual space

--

- Data Science studies


---

### Tools and software

Connecting research on data science methodology (Computer Science and Engineering, Statistics, Applied Math) with domain research questions.

---

### Image Processing Across Domains

Many research domains use image data!

### The challenge of novelty squared

<a href="https://medium.com/@profjsb/novelty-squared-dd88857f662#.j9jtwaxe9">Josh Bloom</a>:

"the challenge of finding work that may be simultaneously novel both to the domain scientist and to the core computation, statistical, and algorithmic scientist. "

--

“The last thing I want to have happen with an interdisciplinary collaboration is that my CS and stats colleagues find their contribution to be routine if not mundane.”

--

Volunteer-based organization and community of practice

--

Teaches researchers basic computing skills:

--

1. How to use the Unix shell
1. Basic programming
1. Version control
1. Sometimes also teach SQL and/or software testing.

### Why is this worth doing?

"Ask the managers of high-performance computing centers what fraction of their budget they spent on hardware, software, and training, and what fractions they would like to spend. My prediction is:"

### Why is this worth doing?

"Measure how much computing power all of the scientists at a university (not just those with HPC accounts) use during a year. My prediction is:"

### Why is this worth doing?
"Classify all the support requests received by HPC center staff according to technical complexity, and see how that changes after something like a two-day Software Carpentry workshop. My prediction is:"

### Data Science for Social Good

Addresses two major challenges:

--

How do we enable data-driven approaches in institutions devoted to social good?

--

How do we provide training for data-scientists interested in social good?
